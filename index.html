            <p><b>Challenges</b>
                <br>
                Payment Gateway Integration: One of the most difficult challenges was integrating a secure and reliable payment gateway that worked seamlessly across different devices and browsers. It required thorough testing and dealing with issues related to API integration and handling different payment methods.

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the e-commerce website was fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The challenge was maintaining consistency in design while optimizing user experience and page load times.

Inventory Management System: Building an automated inventory management system that updates in real-time as users purchase products. This involved setting up the back-end logic to track stock levels, handle out-of-stock items, and update the database accordingly
